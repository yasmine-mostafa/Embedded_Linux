Task4 Bash Script:

The user and group were created then the user was added to the group successfully using the bash script.

By using cat /etc/passwd, we can see that the new user was added to the file.
By using cat /etc/group, we can see that the new group was created and the user was added to it.

Or by using id 'user' and getent group 'group'
